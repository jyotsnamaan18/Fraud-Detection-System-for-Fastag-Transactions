# Fraud-Detection-System-for-Fastag-Transactions
Fraud Detection System for Fastag transactions.

## Problem Statement:
This internship project focuses on leveraging machine learning classification techniques to develop an
effective fraud detection system for Fastag transactions. The dataset comprises key features such as
transaction details, vehicle information, geographical location, and transaction amounts. The goal is to
create a robust model that can accurately identify instances of fraudulent activity, ensuring the integrity
and security of Fastag transactions.

## Dataset Description:
1. Transaction_ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
2. Timestamp: Date and time of the transaction.
3. Vehicle_Type: Type of vehicle involved in the transaction.
4. FastagID: Unique identifier for Fastag.
5. TollBoothID: Identifier for the toll booth.
6. Lane_Type: Type of lane used for the transaction.
7. Vehicle_Dimensions: Dimensions of the vehicle.
8. Transaction_Amount: Amount associated with the transaction.
9. Amount_paid: Amount paid for the transaction.
10. Geographical_Location: Location details of the transaction.
11. Vehicle_Speed: Speed of the vehicle during the transaction.
12. Vehicle_Plate_Number: License plate number of the vehicle.
13. Fraud_indicator: Binary indicator of fraudulent activity (target variable).
